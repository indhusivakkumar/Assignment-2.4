
1. Explain the importance of Name node in Hadoop cluster


*NameNode is also referred as the Master of hadoop cluster.

*The centerpiece of  HDFS is the NameNode. 

*The actual data is not stored in the namenode.Rather the data is stored in the DataNodes.

*A single point of failure in Hadoop cluster is the NameNode.

*Only the data metadata information of HDFS is stored in NameNode.

*Since the block locations help in main memory NameNode is usually configured with large amount of memory(RAM).

*It stores the information about the data nodes like how many blocks are stored in the nodes,which node holds the 
data,node locations etc.
